# MechanumBase
 
This repository contains an example FRC robot application for a mechanum drive configuration. This application was created from the WPILib mechanum example and adapted to support the drive base configuration.

This example application has been extended to support an external controller application that communicates joystick command instructions over the network tables. With this remote controller support, the mechanum base can be controlled via an external application running on a Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano or other auxilliary processor.
